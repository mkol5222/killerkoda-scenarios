## Protected Acme Audit app

Let's try to take advantage of this and login without having an account - again on reverse proxy protected application.

1. Open Acme Audit via your web browser by clicking [HERE]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_80}}) (it will open in another browser tab)

2. Enter the following credentials:

    Email: `' or 1=1--` (click on the text to copy)

    Password: whatever password you like

Congratulations - **now breaking into app is prevented by AppSec**
